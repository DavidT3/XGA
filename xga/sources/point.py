class Star(PointSource):
    """
    An XGA class for the analysis of X-ray emission from stars within our galaxy. As such it does not accept a
    redshift argument, instead taking an optional distance measure. It will also accept either a proper motion
    magnitude, or a vector of proper motion in RA and Dec directions. Matching to region files also differs from the
    PointSource superclass, with point source regions within match_radius being designated as matches - this is
    because the local nature of stars can throw up problems with the strict matching of RA-Dec within region that
    PointSource uses.

    :param float ra: The right-ascension of the star, in degrees.
    :param float dec: The declination of the star, in degrees.
    :param Quantity distance: A proper distance to the star. Default is None.
    :param Quantity proper_motion: An astropy quantity describing the star's movement across the sky. This may
        have either one (for the magnitude of proper motion) or two (for an RA Dec proper motion vector)
        components. It must be in units that can be converted to arcseconds per year. Default is None.
    :param str name: The name of the star, optional. If no names are supplied then they will be constructed
        from the supplied coordinates.
    :param Quantity point_radius: The point source analysis region radius for this sample. An astropy quantity
        containing the radius should be passed; default is 30 arcsecond radius.
    :param Quantity match_radius: The radius within which point source regions are accepted as a match to the
        RA and Dec passed by the user. The default value is 10 arcseconds.
    :param bool use_peak: Whether peak position should be found and used. For Star the 'simple' peak
        finding method is the only one available.
    :param Quantity peak_lo_en: The lower energy bound for the RateMap to calculate peak
        position from. Default is 0.5keV.
    :param Quantity peak_hi_en: The upper energy bound for the RateMap to calculate peak
        position from. Default is 2.0keV.
    :param float back_inn_rad_factor: This factor is multiplied by an analysis region radius, and gives the inner
        radius for the background region. Default is 1.05.
    :param float back_out_rad_factor: This factor is multiplied by an analysis region radius, and gives the outer
        radius for the background region. Default is 1.5.
    :param cosmology: An astropy cosmology object for use throughout analysis of the source.
    :param bool load_products: Whether existing products should be loaded from disk.
    :param bool load_fits: Whether existing fits should be loaded from disk.
    :param bool regen_merged: Should merged images/exposure maps be regenerated after cleaning. Default is
        True. This option is here so that sample objects can regenerate all merged products at once, which is
        more efficient as it can exploit parallelisation more fully - user probably doesn't need to touch this.
