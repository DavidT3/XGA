    This class stores image data from X-ray observations. It also allows easy, direct, access to that data, and
    implements many helpful methods with extra functionality (including coordinate transforms, peak finders, and
    a powerful view method).

    :param str path: The path to where the product file SHOULD be located.
    :param str obs_id: The ObsID related to the Image being declared.
    :param str instrument: The instrument related to the Image being declared.
    :param str stdout_str: The stdout from calling the terminal command.
    :param str stderr_str: The stderr from calling the terminal command.
    :param str gen_cmd: The command used to generate the product.

    :param Quantity hi_en: The upper energy bound used to generate this product.

        dictionary of region lists with ObsIDs as dictionary keys.
    :param dict/SkyRegion/PixelRegion matched_regs: Similar to the regs argument, but in this case for a region

        if there is no match. Such a dictionary can be retrieved from a source using the 'matched_regions'
        property. Default is None.
    :param bool smoothed: Has this image been smoothed, default is False. This information can also be
        set after the instantiation of an image.
    :param dict/Kernel smoothed_info: Information on how the image was smoothed, given either by the Astropy
        kernel used or a dictionary of information (required structure detailed in
        parse_smoothing). Default is None
