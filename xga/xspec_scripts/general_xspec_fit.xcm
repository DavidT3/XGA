# This XSPEC script template requires quite a few parameters to be filled in, using the Python formatting
#  syntax. This *should* act as a general script for model combinations, so long as the formatted
#  parameter values are valid.

# As this script is designed to be populated by a Python script, the single curly braces denote places for the Python
#  .format command to inject a value, and every normal TCL use of curly braces has to be double curly braces
