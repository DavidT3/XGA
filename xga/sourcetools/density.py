    An internal function which exists because all the density profile methods that I have planned
    need the same product checking and setup steps. This function checks that all necessary spectra/fits have
    been generated/run, then uses them to calculate the conversion factors from count-rate/volume to squared
    hydrogen number density.

    :param Union[GalaxyCluster, ClusterSample] sources: The source objects/sample object for which the density profile
    is being found.
    :param str/Quantity outer_radius: The name or value of the outer radius of the spectra that should be used
        to calculate conversion factors (for instance 'r200' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster, or
        Quantity(1000, 'kpc')). If 'region' is chosen (to use the regions in region files), then any
        inner radius will be ignored.
    :param str/Quantity inner_radius: The name or value of the inner radius of the spectra that should be used
        to calculate conversion factors (for instance 'r500' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster, or
        Quantity(300, 'kpc')). By default this is zero arcseconds, resulting in a circular spectrum.
    :param str abund_table: Which abundance table should be used for the XSPEC fit, FakeIt run, and for the
        electron/hydrogen number density ratio.
    :param Quantity lo_en: The lower energy limit of the combined ratemap used to calculate density.
    :param Quantity hi_en: The upper energy limit of the combined ratemap used to calculate density.
    :param bool group_spec: Whether the spectra that were fitted for the desired result were grouped.
    :param float min_counts: The minimum counts per channel, if the spectra that were fitted for the
        desired result were grouped by minimum counts.
    :param float min_sn: The minimum signal to noise per channel, if the spectra that were fitted for the
        desired result were grouped by minimum signal to noise.
    :param float over_sample: The level of oversampling applied on the spectra that were fitted.
    :param str/list obs_id: A specific ObsID(s) to measure the density from. This should be a string if a single
        source is being analysed, and a list of ObsIDs the same length as the number of sources otherwise. The
        default is None, in which case the combined data will be used to measure the density profile.
    :param str/list inst: A specific instrument(s) to measure the density from. This can either be passed as a
        single string (e.g. 'pn') if only one source is being analysed, or the same instrument should be used for
        every source in a sample, or a list of strings if different instruments are required for each source. The
        default is None, in which case the combined data will be used to measure the density profile.
    :param Quantity conv_temp: If set this will override XGA measured temperatures within the conv_outer_radius, and
        the fakeit run to calculate the normalisation conversion factor will use these temperatures. The quantity
         should have an entry for each cluster being analysed. Default is None.
    :param str/Quantity conv_outer_radius: The outer radius within which to generate spectra and measure temperatures
        for the conversion factor calculation, default is 'r500'. An astropy quantity may also be passed, with either
        a single value or an entry for each cluster being analysed.
    :param int num_cores: The number of cores that the evselect call and XSPEC functions are allowed to use.
    :return: The source object(s)/sample that was passed in, an array of the calculated conversion factors to take the
        count-rate/volume to a number density of hydrogen, the parsed obs_id variable, and the parsed inst variable.

    """
    A photometric galaxy cluster gas density calculation method where a surface brightness profile is fit with
    a model and an inverse abel transform is used to infer the 3D count-rate/volume profile. Then a conversion factor
    calculated from simulated spectra is used to infer the number density profile.

    Depending on the chosen surface brightness model, the inverse abel transform may be performed using an analytical
    solution, or numerical methods.

    :param GalaxyCluster/ClusterSample sources: A GalaxyCluster or ClusterSample object to measure density
        profiles for.
    :param str/List[str]/BaseModel1D/List[BaseModel1D] model: The model(s) to be fit to the cluster surface
        profile(s). You may pass the string name of a model (for single or multiple clusters), a single instance
        of an XGA model class (for single or multiple clusters), a list of string names (one entry for each cluster
        being analysed), or a list of XGA model instances (one entry for each cluster being analysed).
    :param str fit_method: The method for the profile object to use to fit the model, default is mcmc.
    :param str/Quantity outer_radius:
    :param bool num_dens: If True then a number density profile will be generated, otherwise a mass density profile
        will be generated.
    :param bool use_peak: If true the measured peak will be used as the central coordinate of the profile.
    :param int pix_step: The width (in pixels) of each annular bin for the profiles, default is 1.
    :param int/float min_snr: The minimum allowed signal to noise for the surface brightness
        profiles. Default is 0, which disables automatic re-binning.
    :param str abund_table: Which abundance table should be used for the XSPEC fit, FakeIt run, and for the
        electron/hydrogen number density ratio.
    :param Quantity lo_en: The lower energy limit of the combined ratemap used to calculate density.
    :param Quantity hi_en: The upper energy limit of the combined ratemap used to calculate density.
    :param bool psf_corr: Default True, whether PSF corrected ratemaps will be used to make the
        surface brightness profile, and thus the density (if False density results could be incorrect).
    :param str psf_model: If PSF corrected, the PSF model used.
    :param int psf_bins: If PSF corrected, the number of bins per side.
    :param str psf_algo: If PSF corrected, the algorithm used.
    :param int psf_iter: If PSF corrected, the number of algorithm iterations.
    :param int num_walkers: If using mcmc fitting, the number of walkers to use. Default is 20.
    :param int num_steps: If using mcmc fitting, the number of steps each walker should take. Default is 20000.
    :param int num_samples: The number of samples drawn from the posterior distributions of model parameters
        after the fitting process is complete.
    :param bool group_spec: Whether the spectra that were used for fakeit were grouped.
    :param float min_counts: The minimum counts per channel, if the spectra that were used for fakeit
        were grouped by minimum counts.
    :param float min_sn: The minimum signal to noise per channel, if the spectra that were used for fakeit
        were grouped by minimum signal to noise.
    :param float over_sample: The level of oversampling applied on the spectra that were used for fakeit.
    :param str/list obs_id: A specific ObsID(s) to measure the density from. This should be a string if a single
        source is being analysed, and a list of ObsIDs the same length as the number of sources otherwise. The
        default is None, in which case the combined data will be used to measure the density profile.
    :param str/list inst: A specific instrument(s) to measure the density from. This can either be passed as a
        single string (e.g. 'pn') if only one source is being analysed, or the same instrument should be used for
        every source in a sample, or a list of strings if different instruments are required for each source. The
        default is None, in which case the combined data will be used to measure the density profile.
    :param Quantity conv_temp: If set this will override XGA measured temperatures within the conv_outer_radius, and
        the fakeit run to calculate the normalisation conversion factor will use these temperatures. The quantity
         should have an entry for each cluster being analysed. Default is None.
    :param str/Quantity conv_outer_radius: The outer radius within which to generate spectra and measure temperatures
        for the conversion factor calculation, default is 'r500'. An astropy quantity may also be passed, with either
        a single value or an entry for each cluster being analysed.
    :param str inv_abel_method: The method which should be used for the inverse abel transform of model which
        is fitted to the surface brightness profile. This overrides the default method for the model, which is either
        'analytical' for models with an analytical solution to the inverse abel transform, or 'direct' for
        models which don't have an analytical solution. Default is None.
    :param int num_cores: The number of cores that the evselect call and XSPEC functions are allowed to use.
    :param bool show_warn: Should fit warnings be shown on screen.
    :return: A list of the 3D gas density profiles measured by this function, though if the measurement was not
        successful an entry of None will be added to the list.

    A method of measuring density profiles using XSPEC fits of a set of Annular Spectra. First checks whether the
    required annular spectra already exist and have been fit using XSPEC, if not then they are generated and fitted,
    and APEC normalisation profiles will be produced (with projected temperature profiles also being made as a useful
    extra). Then the apec normalisation profile will be used, with knowledge of the source's redshift and chosen
    analysis cosmology, to produce a density profile from the APEC normalisation.

    :param GalaxyCluster/ClusterSample sources: An individual or sample of sources to calculate 3D gas
        density profiles for.
    :param str/Quantity outer_radii: The name or value of the outer radius to use for the generation of
        the spectrum (for instance 'r200' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster, or Quantity(1000, 'kpc')). If
        'region' is chosen (to use the regions in region files), then any inner radius will be ignored. If you are
        generating for multiple sources then you can also pass a Quantity with one entry per source.
    :param bool num_dens: If True then a number density profile will be generated, otherwise a mass density profile
        will be generated.
    :param str annulus_method: The method by which the annuli are designated, this can be 'min_snr' (which will use
        the min_snr_proj_temp_prof function), or 'growth' (which will use the grow_ann_proj_temp_prof function).
    :param float min_snr: The minimum signal to noise which is allowable in a given annulus.
    :param Quantity min_width: The minimum allowable width of an annulus. The default is set to 20 arcseconds to try
        and avoid PSF effects.
    :param bool use_combined: If True then the combined RateMap will be used for signal to noise annulus
        calculations, this is overridden by use_worst.
    :param bool use_worst: If True then the worst observation of the cluster (ranked by global signal to noise) will
        be used for signal to noise annulus calculations.
    :param Quantity lo_en: The lower energy bound of the ratemap to use for the signal to noise calculations.
    :param Quantity hi_en: The upper energy bound of the ratemap to use for the signal to noise calculations.
    :param bool psf_corr: Sets whether you wish to use a PSF corrected ratemap or not.
    :param str psf_model: If the ratemap you want to use is PSF corrected, this is the PSF model used.
    :param int psf_bins: If the ratemap you want to use is PSF corrected, this is the number of PSFs per
        side in the PSF grid.
    :param str psf_algo: If the ratemap you want to use is PSF corrected, this is the algorithm used.
    :param int psf_iter: If the ratemap you want to use is PSF corrected, this is the number of iterations.
    :param bool allow_negative: Should pixels in the background subtracted count map be allowed to go below
        zero, which results in a lower signal to noise (and can result in a negative signal to noise).
    :param bool exp_corr: Should signal to noises be measured with exposure time correction, default is True. I
            recommend that this be true for combined observations, as exposure time could change quite dramatically
            across the combined product.
    :param bool group_spec: A boolean flag that sets whether generated spectra are grouped or not.
    :param float min_counts: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum number of counts per channel.
        To disable minimum counts set this parameter to None.
    :param float min_sn: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum signal to noise in each channel.
        To disable minimum signal to noise set this parameter to None.
    :param float over_sample: The minimum energy resolution for each group, set to None to disable. e.g. if
        over_sample=3 then the minimum width of a group is 1/3 of the resolution FWHM at that energy.
    :param bool one_rmf: This flag tells the method whether it should only generate one RMF for a particular
        ObsID-instrument combination - this is much faster in some circumstances, however the RMF does depend
        slightly on position on the detector.
    :param str abund_table: The abundance table to use both for the conversion from n_exn_p to n_e^2 during density
        calculation, and the XSPEC fit.
    :param int num_data_real: The number of random realisations to generate when propagating profile uncertainties.
    :param int sigma: What sigma uncertainties should newly created profiles have, the default is 2σ.
    :param int num_cores: The number of cores to use (if running locally), default is set to 90% of available.
