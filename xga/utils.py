# TODO Here shall live the odds and ends, stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else. Some unit objects for XMM coordinate
#  systems perhaps, angular radius calculation, other things that haven't yet occured to me.

# TODO Possibly this is where the config file I'll have to come up with will be parsed/checked for

# TODO Might do a decorator here to try except all sas functions, like Tim suggested
