    An internal function to generate all the commands necessary to produce a srctool spectrum, but is not
    decorated by the esass_call function, so the commands aren't immediately run. This means it can be used for
    srctool functions that generate custom sets of spectra (like a set of annular spectra for instance), as well
    as for things like the standard srctool_spectrum function which produce relatively boring spectra.

    :param BaseSource/BaseSample sources: A single source object, or a sample of sources.
    :param str/Quantity outer_radius: The name or value of the outer radius to use for the generation of
        the spectrum (for instance 'r200' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster, or Quantity(1000, 'kpc')). If
        'region' is chosen (to use the regions in region files), then any inner radius will be ignored.
    :param str/Quantity inner_radius: The name or value of the inner radius to use for the generation of
        the spectrum (for instance 'r500' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster, or Quantity(300, 'kpc')). By
        default this is zero arcseconds, resulting in a circular spectrum.
    :param bool group_spec: A boolean flag that sets whether generated spectra are grouped or not.
    :param float min_counts: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum number of counts per channel.
        To disable minimum counts set this parameter to None.
    :param float min_sn: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum signal to noise in each channel.
        To disable minimum signal to noise set this parameter to None.
    :param int over_sample: The minimum energy resolution for each group, set to None to disable. e.g. if
        over_sample=3 then the minimum width of a group is 1/3 of the resolution FWHM at that energy.
    :param bool one_rmf: This flag tells the method whether it should only generate one RMF for a particular
        ObsID-instrument combination - this is much faster in some circumstances, however the RMF does depend
        slightly on position on the detector.
    :param int num_cores: The number of cores to use, default is set to 90% of available.
    :param bool disable_progress: Setting this to true will turn off the eSASS generation progress bar.
    :param bool force_gen: This boolean flag will force the regeneration of spectra, even if they already exist.
