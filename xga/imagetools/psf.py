    An implementation of the Richardson-Lucy (doi:10.1364/JOSA.62.000055) PSF deconvolution algorithm that
    also takes into account the spatial variance of the XMM Newton PSF. The sources passed into this
    function will have all images matching the passed energy range deconvolved, the image objects will have the
    result stored in them alongside the original data, and a combined image will be generated. I view this
    method as quite crude, but it does seem to work, and I may implement a more intelligent way of doing
    PSF deconvolutions later.
    I initially tried convolving the PSFs generated at different spatial points with the chunks of data relevant
    to them in isolation, but the edge effects were very obvious. So I settled on convolving the whole
    original image with each PSF, and after it was finished taking the relevant chunks and patchworking
    them into a new array.

        the best available.
    :param Quantity lo_en: The lower energy bound of the images to be deconvolved.
    :param Quantity hi_en: The upper energy bound of the images to be deconvolved.
    :param int bins: Number of bins that the X and Y axes will be divided into when generating a PSFGrid.

        of available cores in your system.
