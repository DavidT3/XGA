    This method implements different spins on Jeremy Sanders' contour binning
    method (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10716.x) to split the 2D ratemap into bins that
    are spatially and morphologically connected (in theory). This can make some nice images, and also allows
    you to use those new regions to measure projected spectral quantities (temperature, metallicity, density)
    and make a 2D projected property map. After the first bin is defined at start_pos, further bins will be
    started at the brightest pixels left.

    Current allowable metric choices:
      * 'counts' - Stop adding to bin when total background subtracted counts are over max_val
      * 'snr' - Stop adding to bin when signal to noise is over max_val.

    This function cannot be used on Images as they lack the exposure map information necessary to define the area of
    the the regions.

    :param RateMap prod: The ratemap to apply the contour binning process to.
    :param np.ndarray src_mask: A mask that removes emission from regions not associated with the source you're
        analysing, including removing interloper sources. Default is None, in which case no mask will be applied.
    :param np.ndarray bck_mask: A mask defining the background region. Default is None in which case no background
        subtraction will be used.
    :param Quantity start_pos: The position at which to start the binning process, in units of degrees or pixels.
        This parameter is None by default, in which case the brightest pixel (after masks have been applied), will
        be used as the starting point.
    :param int max_masks: A simple cut off for the number of masks that can be produced by this
        function, default is 20.
    :param str metric: The metric by which to judge when to stop adding new pixels to a bin (see docstring).
    :param Quantity max_val: The max value for the chosen metric, above which a new bin is started.
    :return: A 3D array of bin masks, the first two dimensions are the size of the input image, the third is
        the number of regions that have been generated.
