    """
    Simple function to apply (in theory) any Astropy smoothing to an XGA Image/RateMap  and create a new smoothed
    XGA data product. This general function will produce XGA Image and RateMap
    objects from any instance of an Astropy Kernel, and if a RateMap is passed as the input then you may choose
    whether to smooth the image component or the image/expmap (using sm_im); if you choose the former then the final
    smoothed RateMap will be produced by dividing the smoothed Image by the original ExpMap.

    :param Image/RateMap prod: The image/ratemap to be smoothed. If a RateMap is passed please see the 'sm_im'
        parameter for extra options.
    :param Kernel kernel: The kernel with which to smooth the input data. Should be an instance of an Astropy Kernel.
    :param np.ndarray mask: A mask to apply to the data while smoothing (removing point source interlopers for
        instance). The default is None, which means no mask is applied. This function expects a mask with 1s where
        the data you wish to keep is, and 0s where the data you wish to remove is - the style of mask produced by XGA.
    :param bool fft: Should a fast fourier transform method be used for convolution, default is False.
    :param bool norm_kernel: Whether to normalize the kernel to have a sum of one.
    :param bool sm_im: If a RateMap is passed, should the image component be smoothed rather than the actual
        RateMap. Default is True, where the Image will be smoothed and divided by the original ExpMap. If set
        to False, the resulting RateMap will be bodged, with the ExpMap all 1s on the sensor.
    :return: An XGA product with the smoothed Image or RateMap.
    :rtype: Image/RateMap
