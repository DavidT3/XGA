    This function uses the xspec fakeit tool to calculate conversion factors between count rate and
    luminosity for ARFs and RMFs associated with spectra in the given sources. Once complete the conversion
    factors are stored within the relevant XGA spectrum object. If the requested spectra do not already
    exist then they will automatically be generated for you. Please be aware that this function does not
    support calculating conversion factors from AnnularSpectra.

    :param GalaxyCluster sources: The GalaxyCluster objects to calculate conversion factors for.
    :param str/Quantity outer_radius: The name or value of the outer radius of the region that the
        desired spectrum covers (for instance 'r200' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster,
        or Quantity(1000, 'kpc')). If 'region' is chosen (to use the regions in region files), then any
        inner radius will be ignored. If you are generating factors for multiple sources then you can
        also pass a Quantity with one entry per source.
    :param str/Quantity inner_radius: The name or value of the outer radius of the region that the
        desired spectrum covers (for instance 'r200' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster,
        or Quantity(1000, 'kpc')). If 'region' is chosen (to use the regions in region files), then any
        inner radius will be ignored. By default this is zero arcseconds, resulting in a circular spectrum. If
        you are generating factors for multiple sources then you can also pass a Quantity with one entry per source.
    :param Quantity sim_temp: The temperature(s) to use for the apec model.
    :param float/List sim_met: The metallicity(s) (in solar met) to use for the apec model.
    :param Quantity conv_en: The energy limit pairs to calculate conversion factors for.
    :param str abund_table: The name of the XSPEC abundance table to use.
    :param bool group_spec: A boolean flag that sets whether generated spectra are grouped or not.
    :param float min_counts: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum number of counts per channel.
        To disable minimum counts set this parameter to None.
    :param float min_sn: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum signal to noise in each channel.
        To disable minimum signal to noise set this parameter to None.
    :param float over_sample: The minimum energy resolution for each group, set to None to disable. e.g. if
        over_sample=3 then the minimum width of a group is 1/3 of the resolution FWHM at that energy.
    :param bool one_rmf: This flag tells the method whether it should only generate one RMF for a particular
        ObsID-instrument combination - this is much faster in some circumstances, however the RMF does depend
        slightly on position on the detector.
    :param int num_cores: The number of cores to use (if running locally), default is set to 90% of available.
