    This is a convenience function for fitting an absorbed single temperature apec model(constant*tbabs*apec) to an
    object. It would be possible to do the exact same fit using the custom_model function, but as it will
    be a very common fit a dedicated function is in order. If there are no existing spectra with the passed
    settings, then they will be generated automatically.

    If the spectrum checking step of the XSPEC fit is enabled (using the boolean flag spectrum_checking), then
    each individual spectrum available for a given source will be fitted, and if the measured temperature is less
    than or equal to 0.01keV, or greater than 20keV, or the temperature uncertainty is greater than 15keV, then
    that spectrum will be rejected and not included in the final fit. Spectrum checking also involves rejecting any
    spectra with fewer than 10 noticed channels.

    :param List[BaseSource] sources: A single source object, or a sample of sources.
    :param str/Quantity outer_radius: The name or value of the outer radius of the region that the
        desired spectrum covers (for instance 'r200' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster,
        or Quantity(1000, 'kpc')). If 'region' is chosen (to use the regions in region files), then any
        inner radius will be ignored. If you are fitting for multiple sources then you can also pass a
        Quantity with one entry per source.
    :param str/Quantity inner_radius: The name or value of the outer radius of the region that the
        desired spectrum covers (for instance 'r200' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster,
        or Quantity(1000, 'kpc')). If 'region' is chosen (to use the regions in region files), then any
        inner radius will be ignored. By default this is zero arcseconds, resulting in a circular spectrum. If
        you are fitting for multiple sources then you can also pass a Quantity with one entry per source.
    :param Quantity start_temp: The initial temperature for the fit.
    :param start_met: The initial metallicity for the fit (in ZSun).
    :param Quantity lum_en: Energy bands in which to measure luminosity.
    :param bool freeze_nh: Whether the hydrogen column density should be frozen.
    :param bool freeze_met: Whether the metallicity parameter in the fit should be frozen.
    :param Quantity lo_en: The lower energy limit for the data to be fitted.
    :param Quantity hi_en: The upper energy limit for the data to be fitted.
    :param float par_fit_stat: The delta fit statistic for the XSPEC 'error' command, default is 1.0 which should be
        equivelant to 1Ïƒ errors if I've understood (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/XSerror.html)
        correctly.
    :param float lum_conf: The confidence level for XSPEC luminosity measurements.
    :param str abund_table: The abundance table to use for the fit.
    :param str fit_method: The XSPEC fit method to use.
    :param bool group_spec: A boolean flag that sets whether generated spectra are grouped or not.
    :param float min_counts: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum number of counts per channel.
        To disable minimum counts set this parameter to None.
    :param float min_sn: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum signal to noise in each channel.
        To disable minimum signal to noise set this parameter to None.
    :param float over_sample: The minimum energy resolution for each group, set to None to disable. e.g. if
        over_sample=3 then the minimum width of a group is 1/3 of the resolution FWHM at that energy.
    :param bool one_rmf: This flag tells the method whether it should only generate one RMF for a particular
        ObsID-instrument combination - this is much faster in some circumstances, however the RMF does depend
        slightly on position on the detector.
    :param int num_cores: The number of cores to use (if running locally), default is set to 90% of available.
    :param bool spectrum_checking: Should the spectrum checking step of the XSPEC fit (where each spectrum is fit
        individually and tested to see whether it will contribute to the simultaneous fit) be activated?
    :param Quantity timeout: The amount of time each individual fit is allowed to run for, the default is one hour.
        Please note that this is not a timeout for the entire fitting process, but a timeout to individual source
        fits.
