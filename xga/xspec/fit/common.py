    This pre-generates the spectra necessary for the requested fit (if they do not exist), and formats the input
    radii in a more predictable way.

    :param BaseSource/BaseSample sources: A single source object, or a sample of sources.
    :param str/Quantity outer_radius: The name or value of the outer radius of the region that the
        desired spectrum covers (for instance 'r200' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster,
        or Quantity(1000, 'kpc')). If 'region' is chosen (to use the regions in region files), then any
        inner radius will be ignored. If you are fitting for multiple sources then you can also pass a
        Quantity with one entry per source.
    :param str/Quantity inner_radius: The name or value of the outer radius of the region that the
        desired spectrum covers (for instance 'r200' would be acceptable for a GalaxyCluster,
        or Quantity(1000, 'kpc')). If 'region' is chosen (to use the regions in region files), then any
        inner radius will be ignored. By default this is zero arcseconds, resulting in a circular spectrum. If
        you are fitting for multiple sources then you can also pass a Quantity with one entry per source.
    :param bool group_spec: A boolean flag that sets whether generated spectra are grouped or not.
    :param float min_counts: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum number of counts per channel.
        To disable minimum counts set this parameter to None.
    :param float min_sn: If generating a grouped spectrum, this is the minimum signal to noise in each channel.
        To disable minimum signal to noise set this parameter to None.
    :param float over_sample: The minimum energy resolution for each group, set to None to disable. e.g. if
        over_sample=3 then the minimum width of a group is 1/3 of the resolution FWHM at that energy.
    :param bool one_rmf: This flag tells the method whether it should only generate one RMF for a particular
        ObsID-instrument combination - this is much faster in some circumstances, however the RMF does depend
        slightly on position on the detector.
    :param int num_cores: The number of cores to use (if running locally), default is set to 90% of available.

    then a list will be returned.
