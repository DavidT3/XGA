Getting Help and Support
========================

We encourage those interested in XGA to contact the development team with any questions they may have - We would be happy to help.

If you encounter a bug, or would like to make a feature request, please use the GitHub
`issues <https://github.com/DavidT3/XGA/issues>`_ page, it really helps to keep track of everything. 
Indeed if you wish to contribute to XGA, and opening an issue isn't sufficient to
communicate your idea properly then please contact the development team to arrange a virtual meeting.
