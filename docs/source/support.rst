Getting Help and Support
========================

If you encounter a bug, or would like to make a feature request, please use the GitHub
`issues <https://github.com/DavidT3/XGA/issues>`_ page, it really helps to keep track of everything.

However, if you have further questions, or just want to make doubly sure the issue is noticed, please feel free to send
David an email at turne540@msu.edu, he will be happy to help you. 

If you have a specific feature request, or wish to contribute to XGA, and opening an issue isn't sufficient to
communicate your idea properly then please send David an email and we can arrange a virtual meeting.
