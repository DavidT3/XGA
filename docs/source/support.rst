Getting Help and Support
========================

The best way to get help is to contact the development team, we would be happy to help with any questions you may have.


If you encounter a bug, or would like to make a feature request, please use the GitHub
`issues <https://github.com/DavidT3/XGA/issues>`_ page, it really helps to keep track of everything. 
If you wish to contribute to XGA, and opening an issue isn't sufficient to
communicate your idea properly then please contact the development team to arrange a virtual meeting.
