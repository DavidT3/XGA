Getting Help and Support
========================

If you encounter a bug, or would like to make a feature request, please use the GitHub
`issues <https://github.com/DavidT3/XGA/issues>`_ page, it really helps to keep track of everything.

However, if you have further questions, or just want to make doubly sure I notice the issue, please feel free to send
me an email at david.turner@sussex.ac.uk, I will be happy to help you.

If you have a specific feature request, or wish to contribute to XGA, and opening an issue isn't sufficient to
communicate your idea properly then please send me an email and we can arrange a virtual meeting.
