    "XGA revolves around 'source' objects, which are representative of X-ray sources in real life. These are at the heart of any analysis performed with XGA, and just as there are different types of objects that emit X-rays, there are different types of source object built into XGA. We make distinctions between the different types of source due to the different information they can require for their analysis (clusters need overdensity radii for instance, whereas that isn't a useful concept for an AGN).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At their most basic, all that is required to define a source is a position on the sky. The first time XGA is run on a new system, it makes an 'observation census' of the data that you have pointed it to, and finds what observations are available and what their pointing coordinates are; when a new source is defined XGA searches through the census to check whether there are data available for the given coordinates, and if there are relevant observations then they are 'associated' with the source object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach means that the user doesn't have to directly deal with data if they don't want to, XGA will fetch all available data by itself. When it comes to actually analysing and measuring quantities from the source, all the data will be used, not just single observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we ask you to supply region files to XGA in the configuration file, the module can be aware of where other detected sources are in the data its chosen, that allows it to define any 'interloper' sources that have to be excluded from spectrum generation and photometric analysis.\n"

BaseSource only needs an RA and Dec to be initialised, and if a name is not supplied by the user then one will be generated from those coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NullSource** - This class of source is an exception to XGA's design philosophy that an XGA source represents a real X-ray emitting object. By default NullSource associated every available ObsID with itself (though you may specify which ObsIDs to associate with it), and as such shouldn't be used for astrophysical analysis. This class of source should only be used for bulk generation of products such as images and exposure maps.\n",
    "\n",

XGA will attempt to find a matching extended source from the supplied region files, and if it does then that region will be used for any analysis. The user may also supply a custom circular region in which to analyse the object. Unless it is told not to, XGA will also attempt to find the X-ray peak of this extended object.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **GalaxyCluster** - As you may have guessed, this class is specifically for Galaxy Clusters, and is a subclass of ExtendedSource. Defining an instance of this class **requires** a redshift to be passed, as well as **at least** one overdensity radius (R$_{200}$, R$_{500}$, and R$_{2500}$ are supported). Also supports passing weak lensing mass and richness values, for use in multi-wavelength analyses. \n",

Just as with the GalaxyCluster source class, here we **require** that redshift and overdensity radius information be provided on declaration.
