    "XGA revolves around 'source' objects, which are representative of X-ray sources in real life. These are at the heart of any analysis performed with XGA, and just as there are different types of objects that emit X-rays, there are different types of source object built into XGA. We make distinctions between the different types of source due to the different information they can require for their analysis (clusters need overdensity radii for instance, whereas that isn't a useful concept for an AGN). Different source classes also have some different procedures and methods built into them, as we often wish to measure different things for different types of source.\n",
    "\n",
    "At their most basic, all that is required to define a source is a position on the sky. The first time XGA is run on a new system, it makes an 'observation census' of the data that you have pointed it to, and finds what observations are available and what their pointing coordinates are; when a new source is defined XGA searches through the census to check whether there are data available for the given coordinates, and if there are relevant observations then they are 'associated' with the source object. An observation will be associated with a source if the aimpoint of the observation is within a certain radius of the source coordinates (by default this radius is 30 and 60 arcmin for XMM and eROSITA respectively, however this may be adjusted by the user), though some source classes support further cleaning steps to remove observations that don't cover the entire object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach means that the user doesn't have to directly deal with data if they don't want to, XGA will fetch all available data by itself. When it comes to actually analysing and measuring quantities from the source, all the data will be used, not just single observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we ask you to supply region files to XGA in the configuration file, the module can be aware of where other detected sources are in the data its chosen, that allows it to define any 'interloper' sources that have to be excluded from spectrum generation and photometric analysis.\n"

BaseSource only needs an RA and Dec to be initialised, and if a name is not supplied by the user then one will be generated from those coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NullSource** - This class of source is an exception to XGA's design philosophy that an XGA source represents a real X-ray emitting object. By default NullSource associated every available ObsID with itself (though you may specify which ObsIDs to associate with it), and as such shouldn't be used for astrophysical analysis. This class of source should only be used for bulk generation of products such as images and exposure maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ExtendedSource** - This is a general class for extended X-ray sources, it is also the superclass of the GalaxyCluster class. XGA will attempt to find a matching extended source from the supplied region files, and if it does then that region will be used for any analysis. The user may also supply a custom circular region in which to analyse the object. Unless it is told not to, XGA will also attempt to find the X-ray peak of this extended object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GalaxyCluster** - This class is specifically for the analysis of Galaxy Clusters, and is a subclass of ExtendedSource. Defining an instance of this class **requires** a redshift to be passed, as well as **at least** one overdensity radius ( R$_{200}$, R$_{500}$, and R$_{2500}$ are supported). Also supports passing weak lensing mass and richness values, for use in multi-wavelength analyses. Point sources close to the centre of the cluster will not be removed, as they could be a misidentified cool core, please see the [_source_type_match](../../xga.sources.rst#xga.sources.extended.GalaxyCluster) method of the GalaxyCluster class for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PointSource** - Similar to the ExtendedSource class in that this is a superclass for more specific point source classes. There are no methods in this class to produce radial plots for instance, as for point-like sources the ideal of a radial profile has very little meaning. When a PointSouce is declared, an attempt will be made to match to a point source in region files, if they are supplied.\n",

Just as with the GalaxyCluster source class, here we **require** that redshift and overdensity radius information be provided on declaration.
