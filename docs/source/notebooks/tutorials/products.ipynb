   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "* **BaseProduct** - The superclass for many of the standard XGA product classes, there isn't really any reason for a BaseProduct to be declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **EventList** - A very simple product class which differs only slightly from the BaseProduct class, its only used to store path and header information for the XMM event lists that the configuration file points XGA at.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Image** - An extremely useful product with many extra features, it is used to wrap fits images. The data and header information are read into memory (when required), and can be accessed with properties and attributes of an Image instance. A view method (to look at the image and overlay extra information), and a coordinate transformation method are examples of the built-in functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * **ExpMap** - A subclass of the XGA Image class, this is a very simple extension to Image that adds a method to easily retrieve an exposure time at a given angular or pixel coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * **RateMap** - The class that most photometric analyses are based around, also a subclass of Image. Instantiating this class requires the user pass matching Image and ExpMap instances (same ObsID, instrument etc.) A count rate map is then calculated from this information. This has several added methods, including the ability to retrieve a count rate at a given coordinate, and different peak finding methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * **PSF** - **(XMM data only)** This wraps two-dimensional PSF images generated by a routine such as [psfgen](https://xmm-tools.cosmos.esa.int/external/sas/current/doc/psfgen/index.html), and can be used to PSF correct images and ratemaps. Few methods have been added, and it is unlikely a user will ever need to interact directly with this. The added functionality here is the ability to resample the PSF at a scale provided by a passed in Image object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Spectrum** - A complicated sub-class of BaseProduct, it wraps and stores a spectrum, including storing paths to all of the other files necessary to analyse it (e.g. RMF, ARF, background spectrum). When a source that has had spectra associated with it is passed to an XGA XSPEC function, the fit results are added to the spectrum objects. This has methods to retrieve fit results, as well as view the fitted Spectrum.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **BaseAggregateProduct** - Another base product class, this one is designed to store a group of related XGA products.\n",
    "    * **PSFGrid** - **(XMM data only)** An XGA object used during the PSF correction of images and ratemaps, it stores a grid of PSF objects generated at different spatial positions on the XMM detectors. It provides access to those PSFs on request from the PSF correction function, and context as to which PSF was generated at which position.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **AnnularSpectra** - This holds sets of XGA Spectrum products generated in concentric annuli, and includes various methods for accessing the individual spectra, retrieving fit information (if a fit has been run), and viewing the spectra (both for individual annuli, and the whole set). This class is crucial for the measurement of galaxy cluster temperature profiles, and by extension the measurement of hydrostatic mass profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BaseProfile1D** - Here we move to the special products that don't wrap existing X-ray data products, these are entirely generated by XGA. This class is designed to store, fit, and generate plots of different 1D profiles. The user should never declare an instance of this class, only the specific subclass that they need for their analysis.\n",
    "    * **SurfaceBrightness1D** - Mostly meant for Galaxy Clusters, this class will store a 1D surface brightness profile, and enable the fitting of valid models such as a beta profile, or double beta profile.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **GasDensity1D** - This is meant to store a gas density profile as calculated by XGA, and includes methods to calculate a total gas mass within a given radius, as well as to generate a gas mass profile.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **GasMass1D** - A class for gas mass 1D profiles, which currently has no extra functionality over BaseProfile1D.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **ProjectedGasTemperature1D** - A class for the projected temperature profiles which are measured by fitting plasma emission models to annular spectra. They are 'projected' because they are a combination of temperatures of the 3D shells which are intersected along the line of sight by the annulus.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **APECNormalisation1D** - A class for storing profiles of the normalisation of the APEC plasma emission model, which is extracted from the same fitting process (run on an AnnularSpectra) that produces the projected temperature profiles. This profile can be used to measure the 3D density profile, and (when converted to an emission measure profile and combined with knowledge of the projected temperature profile) allows us to infer the 3D temperature profile.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **EmissionMeasure1D** - Calculated from an APECNormalisation1D, and knowledge of the cosmology and the redshift of the source. The emission measure profile can be used to help infer the 3D temperature profile of a cluster, when combined with the projected temperature profile and assumptions about the source geometry.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **ProjectedGasMetallicity1D** - Another profile that *can* be measured from the fitting of AnnularSpectra, though only if metallicity is allowed to vary as a free parameter. Again it is 'projected' because the metallicities are a combination of the metallicities of the 3D shells intersected along the line of sight by the annuli.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **GasTemperature3D** - A three-dimensional radial map of the plasma temperature of the intra-cluster medium of a galaxy cluster. This can be used, in combination with knowledge of the 3D gas density, to measure a mass profile for a galaxy cluster.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **HydrostaticMass** - Defined with a gas density profile and a 3D temperature profile, this type of profile describes the change of the total mass contained within a radius, and has methods to measure a mass at whatever radius the user wants to.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **BaryonFraction** - Can be generated by a HydrostaticMass profile, this shows the change in total baryon fraction within a radius, with radius. Again the value at a specific point can be calculated using a method implemented in this class.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "* **BaseAggregateProfile1D** - This is unlikely ever to actually have any specific subclasses, as awareness of the type of profile is not really necessary for its only job, which is to display multiple profiles on one axis. These can be generated just by adding multiple profile products together with the standard Python + operator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ScalingRelation** - The scaling relation products are unique in XGA, in that they are the only products that cannot be stored within a source, as they concern multiple sources (or no sources at all if declared from the literature), it would not make sense. These are produced by the scaling relation generation functions built into XGA, and in that case would contain both data and a fitted model. There are also several scaling relations from literature defined in XGA, these only contain the fitted model. A view method capable of producing publication quality plots is provided, along with many other convenient methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AggregateScalingRelation** - Just as the BaseAggregateProfile1D class was created purely to view multiple profiles on the same axes, this class is designed to enable scaling relations to be easily combined and viewed together. This class is instantiated by adding multiple ScalingRelation objects together.\n"
