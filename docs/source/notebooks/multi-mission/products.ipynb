In this tutorial we detail the considerations the user should take into account when comparing products from different telescopes. We do not go into full detail of the capabilities of the product related functions, for this please seek the other pages of the docs. "

    "* Spectra of **extended** sources are generated using the psftype=NONE so this does not apply any PSF corrections. The exttype parameter is set to MAP, this means that the spatial extent of the source is described by a detection map. This detection map is an image generated by XGA of the observation one is generating a spectrum for, the image is of the full eROSITA energy range (0.2 keV - 10 keV). This is then used for effective area calculations.\n",
    "* Spectra of **point** sources are generated using the psftype='2D_PSF', and exttype='POINT'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observing Mode:\n",
    "Since a source will move across the field of view as the telescope slews, the PSF and effective area of that source will vary. There are two parameters eSASS uses to control the accuracy of the spectra generated due to this variation. The first is **tstep**, which are the time bins that the PSF correction, vignetting correction and effective area are calculated for. The second is **xgrid**, which controls the sampling of the PSF, vignetting, and the effective area to perform the corrections with. Processing time is very sensitive to these parameters, so within XGA we have chosen these values to compromise between accuracy and computing time. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Survey** mode - Tstep is set to 0.5s. Within this time the telescope will have scanned across 45 arcseconds (assuming the eRASS nominal scan speed) - which corresponds to about 5 detector pixels. \n",
    "* **Pointed** mode - Tstep is set to 100s. As the telescope is not moving with respect to the sky in this observing mode, we can increase the tstep, decrease processing time, and not sacrifice any spectral generation accuracy. \n",
    "* For both modes we set xgrid to be its default eSASS value (1.0). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For both sources, the background spectrum are generated seperately from the source spectrum. This is done for two reasons, the first is so the background spectrum has its own ARF and RMF, which is appropriate for large sources. Secondly eSASS will use the GTIs of the source spectra for the background spectra - if generated together. If the source is a large extended source, this can have the effect of throwing away lots of usable data from the background. We therefore chose to generate them separately, so that we use the GTIs of the background region for background spectra generation. Lastly we increase the timestep to 2s for the background region, as this decreases the processing time, and less spatial accuracy is acceptable for background spectra. \n",
